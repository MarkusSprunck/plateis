# PLATEIS - iOS Game 

Finding the shortest path between some nodes is simple, but with an increasing number of nodes the task gets extremely difficult to solve. 

You will play in ten worlds with sixteen levels each and the challenge is increasing in the higher worlds. Use the hint function in the case you've got stuck in one level. The hint function shows the minimal expected solution for two-seconds. 

Maybe you can beat the algorithm. If yes, please send a screen shot of your personal best solution to plateis@mnet-online.de. Please feel free to send me proposals for new features.
